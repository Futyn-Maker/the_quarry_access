# Testing QuarryAccess

Every change is tested in the real game by a blind tester (NVDA, Russian UI) and, before that, by the
developer with the scripts below. A change is accepted when the tester confirms the script, the logs
contain no `ERROR` lines, and the automated transcript matches expectations.

## Where things are

- Mod log: `<game>\SMG026\Binaries\Win64\Mods\QuarryAccess\QuarryAccess.log` (also mirrored into `UE4SS.log`).
  Speech lines look like `SAY focus "Новая игра, 1 из 7, Начать новую игру."`.
- Screen dumps (Ctrl+F9): `<game>\SMG026\Binaries\Win64\Mods\QuarryAccess\dumps\screen-<timestamp>.txt`.
- Config: `<game>\SMG026\Binaries\Win64\Mods\QuarryAccess\QuarryAccess.ini`.

| Script                                     | Purpose                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scripts\build.cmd`                        | Build `main.dll`.                                                      |
| `scripts\format.cmd`                       | Format the C++ sources with clang-format.                              |
| `scripts\deploy.ps1`                       | Copy the mod into the game (game must be closed).                      |
| `scripts\run-game.ps1 -AutoDismissCrash`   | Launch through Steam, wait for `[QuarryAccess] ready`, detect crashes. |
| `scripts\sendkeys.ps1 -Keys Enter,Down,F6` | Drive the game with keystrokes (the game window must be in front).     |
| `scripts\screenshot.ps1`                   | Capture the screen for a visual cross-check.                           |
| `scripts\tail-log.ps1`                     | Print the speech transcript and errors.                                |
| `scripts\stop-game.ps1`                    | Close the game.                                                        |
| `scripts\check-lang.ps1`                   | Verify that all 20 language tables have the same keys.                 |

The developer always closes the game at the end of an automated session.

## Startup, speech and hotkeys

Tester script (Russian UI):

1. Start the game. Within a few seconds after the splash videos you should hear:
   "The Quarry Access 0.1.0 загружен. Программа чтения экрана: NVDA. Язык: ru_RU."
2. Press F8: the help text is spoken (hotkeys and the gamepad chord).
3. Press F5: the help text is repeated.
4. Press F8 again and immediately F7: speech stops.
5. Press F6: the current screen is described.
6. Press Ctrl+F9 to write a screen dump for bug reports.

Expected log lines: `Tolk loaded; screen reader: NVDA`, `game locale: ru-RU; mod language: ru_RU`,
`self-check: SMG_HUD_MENU_BUTTON_NEWGAME_000001 = "Новая игра"`, `self-check: control scheme MouseKeyboard`,
`ready`, one `hotkey:` line per key press, no `ERROR`.
